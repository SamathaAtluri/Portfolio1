            <div class="p">
                <p>I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems, 
                with a strong background in competitive programming, design and development, 
                and machine learning. My experience in competitive programming has honed my problem-solving

                apply to create efficient and effective solutions. In the realm of design and development,
                I excel at crafting user-centric interfaces and building functional, scalable applications that
                 meet both aesthetic and performance standards. Additionally, my expertise in machine learning allows me to harness data to uncover insights,
                  develop predictive models, and drive innovation in various domains. Together, these skills enable me to approach projects with a holistic perspective,
                 blending technical proficiency with creative problem-solving to deliver impactful results.</p>
